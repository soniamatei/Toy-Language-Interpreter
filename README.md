# Toy-Language-Interpreter

This is a project on which I've been working on for the past semester.
The interpretor is written in **Java** using **JavaFX**. The styling of the GUI was done with **SceneBuilder** and a little bit of **css**.
The IDE used was **IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate**.

◾️The first window contains a list of problems in the toy launguage.
